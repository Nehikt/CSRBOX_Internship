# Title: Enhancing Lifelong Learning Opportunities Through Personalized Course Recommendations

This project aims to contribute to the global goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all (SDG 4). By leveraging advanced technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, we have developed a sophisticated recommendation system capable of suggesting relevant Udemy courses tailored to individual learner needs and preferences.

# Workflow: 

## 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
   
- Import the dataset containing course information (titles, descriptions, tags, etc.).
- Clean and preprocess the textual data (e.g., remove stop words, stemming, lemmatization).
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into data distribution and relationships.

## 2. Feature Engineering:

- Convert textual data into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- Create a suitable feature space for machine learning models.

## 3. Similarity Calculation:

- Compute cosine similarity between course vectors to measure semantic similarity.

## 4. Recommendation Generation:

- Sort courses based on their similarity scores to the query course.
- Recommend top-ranked courses to the user.

## 5. Web App Development:

- Build a Flask web application to provide a user-friendly interface.
- Implement a search bar for user input.
- Integrate the recommendation system to display relevant course suggestions.
